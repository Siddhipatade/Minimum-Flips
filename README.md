# Minimum Flips for Bitwise OR

This repository contains a Java solution for calculating the minimum number of flips required to make `(a OR b) == c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive numbers.

## Problem Description

Given three positive numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the goal is to determine the minimum number of flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make `(a OR b) == c` (bitwise OR operation). A flip operation consists of changing any single bit 1 to 0 or changing the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

## Solution Overview

The provided Java solution utilizes bitwise operations to extract the least significant bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration. The logic of the solution can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `flips` to keep track of the number of flips required.

2. Start a loop that continues until all bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been processed.

3. Extract the least significant bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).

4. Check the value of `bitC`:
   - If `bitC` is 0, add `bitA + bitB` to the `flips` count since the corresponding bit in `c` is 0 and we need to flip `a` and/or `b` if either of them has a corresponding bit set to 1.
   - If `bitC` is 1, add 1 to the `flips` count only if both `bitA` and `bitB` are 0 since the corresponding bit in `c` is 1 and we only need to flip `a` and `b` if both of them have a corresponding bit set to 0.

5. Right-shift `a`, `b`, and `c` by 1 bit to process the next least significant bit.

6. Repeat the loop until all bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been processed.

7. Return the total number of flips stored in the `flips` variable.

## How to Use

The `minFlips` method provided in the `Solution` class accepts three positive integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` as input and returns the minimum number of flips required to make `(a OR b) == c`. To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler or IDE of your choice.

2. Call the `minFlips` method with the desired values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. The method will return the minimum number of flips required.

4. You can customize the `main` method in the code to test the solution with different input values.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed.
